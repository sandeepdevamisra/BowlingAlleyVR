# Bowling Alley Game in VR
The existing Bowling Simulation application is to be made as a VR based application - a game application that can be played in Virtual Reality through Oculus. The team has been tasked to rebuild the existing project in UNITY which is used for developing VR and Web 3D Products.
We are supposed to design and develop a virtual reality scene which includes the following two processes:  
1. Design Process includes each member of the team using VR Sketch sheets to design the overall layout of a VR Scene individually and later collate these ideas to finalize the overall design of the VR Scene.
2. Development Process involved use of assets related to our VR Scenes from the UNITY Asset store and develop the end-to-end scene and backend.
